# adventofcode2024

My code to solve the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) puzzles.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run to latest day:

```bash
bun run start
```

To run a specific day, replace `X` with the day number you want:

```bash
bun run dayX
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.38. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
